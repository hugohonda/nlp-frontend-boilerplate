NLP Frontend Boilerplate

Welcome to the NLP Frontend Boilerplate.

This is a Vue.js and Quasar Framework-based boilerplate project for developing Natural Language Processing (NLP) frontend applications.

## Features

- **Vue.js 3**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **Quasar Framework**: A high-performance Material Design component library and full-featured frontend development framework for Vue.js.
- **Authentication**: User authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Token).
- **API Integration**: Integration with the NLP API backend for data retrieval and processing.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the frontend application for easier deployment.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get the NLP Frontend Boilerplate project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- Node.js >= 12
- npm or yarn (preferably yarn)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/nlp-frontend-boilerplate
    cd nlp-frontend-boilerplate
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
   ```

### Configuration

- Update the API endpoint configuration in the .env file to point to your NLP API backend.

   ```bash
    # .env
    VUE_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8989/api
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the NLP Frontend Boilerplate application, follow these steps:

   ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
   ```

This command will build and start the frontend application in development mode. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to access the application.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can interact with it through the user interface.
User Authentication

The application supports user authentication and authorization using JWT. You can log in with your credentials and access the protected areas of the application.
API Integration

The frontend application integrates with the NLP API backend to fetch data and perform NLP tasks. Make sure your NLP API backend is running and accessible at the configured API endpoint.
